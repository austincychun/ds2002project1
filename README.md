To use the ETL pipeline, add the box office data (box_office.csv) to the Colab environment. The first line of code under main() in the Python Notebook file (project1.ipynb) can be replaced with other csv files or a different name. The amount of movies collected can be changed in the next segment also under main(). <br>
After running the Output Formatting segment, the user will be prompted to input either csv, json, or sql, which will determine the file format for the output. This output will include the resulting dataframe from merging the two datasets. Running all of the segments will produce the output file in the same Colab environment, as well as a visualization file called analysis_plot.png.
